This repository contains my solution to [Booking.com](http://www.booking.com/)'s coding assignment from Feb. 2016, for the [Software Developer](https://workingatbooking.com/) position. I am sharing this for educational-purposes only. Use at your own risk.

- [Delta Encoding](./delta-encoding.md)
- [Mutual Anagrams Detector](./anagram.md)
- [Array Analyzer](./sum-array.md)

The live coding session consists of one problem:
